# Python-Music_Player
A basic python music player, it was built off of the bsae of bro code's python music player video. But I added a few tweaks, mainly a rewind (WIP), forward and loop function.
WIP:
- Rewind
- Play next song once current song is finished

Planned:
- Tkinter GUI overhaul and function
- matplotlib visuals

How to add music?
Drag your mp3 file into music_list folder. The rest of it will be sorted out by music.py.

Cheers! ^^ This is my kinda first ongoing python project.
